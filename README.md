# Resumes for Emmett Galles

This repository is designed to house resumes for myself, Emmett Galles. This was made in response to the majority of recruiting events being virtual in 2020. It is most likely that you found yourself in this repository due to an email I sent to you. If I did not send you a link directly to a resume, please consult the key below to figure out which resume is pertinent to your needs

I welcome feedback, questions, or comments you may have about any file in this repository or about the repository as a whole. Furthermore, I encourage any communication between employers and myself, so please feel free to reach out at egalles@wisc.edu.
